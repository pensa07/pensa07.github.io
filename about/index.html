    About Mallard
</h1>
<h2>The Puzzle Desciption</h2>
<p>Mallard is a word game where the aim is to make up legal words from letter tiles. Each row contains one word
    and can be likened to a train with carriages. A key letter starts in the first carriage 
    and moves to the last row by row. Puzzles can have a 4x4 or 5x5 grid.
    Each train (row) has one letter to place from the destination shown vertically on the
     right and takes two or three from the rack below the grid depending on the grid size. The key letter is fixed.
    The puzzle completes when the trains are full with legal words 
    and the destination and rack places are empty. Whole words can be entered from the keyboard. 
    An entered word is removed if re-entered. If a new word 
    needs rack letters then an existing word will be recycled. Alternatively, 
    drag and drop can be used to make the words. The train tiles are traffic lights to provide feedback. 
    So red is for no legal word, amber is for a legal word in that row and all the train tiles turn
    green when all rows are legal and the puzzle is complete.
    </p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    The development of Mallard came about when I started to consider why I wasn't that interested in the Guardian's 
    new(ish) puzzle Wordiply. After playing it for a while I realised that it had aspects I found less engaging. 
    It asks the user to come up with the longest possible word that contains another 3 or 4 letter word 
    with 5 attempts to find the longest.
    I like to complete/win a puzzle but the end point wasn't clear - how long was the longest? My headspace 
    was taken up for too long as I tried to figure out an ever longer word. At the same time I realised that
    most long words started with under- or over- or other prefix and ended with a suffix like -lessness or 
    -ability. So it became repetitive.
</p>
<p>
    So I realised I liked puzzles that had a clear end point and that didn't take too long but were non trivial. 
    Wordle ticks these boxes very well. It's simple, easy to understand and takes 5 to 10 minutes. That's very difficult
    to repeat as the article in the Guardian by the Wordiply creator attests [reference].
</p>
<p>
    But I happened to have an idea one day and Mallard came to be. 
    I have no real idea if anyone will think it is a game worth playing.
    My interest in developing it was only partly the game itself. It was also because it was an opportunity
    to do some programming. I last wrote computer software 25 years ago when I used C++ to write electronics CAD
    applications. So having asked for advice, I have used Rust to write the code to produce each puzzle
    and CSS, HTML and Javascript for the GUI side.
    
</p>
<p>
    It is possible to play this game with pencil, paper and an eraser, though you would have to be disciplined to keep
    everything straight. It's probably easier to think about playing it with pre-printed game cards
    and a set of Scrabble tiles. A multiplayer version is just about possible to envisage.
</p>
<h2>Status & Developments</h2>
<p>
    The current implementation is very much an alpha test version. I don't know whether it will work across
    a number of platforms. Probably not. I am interested in feedback. So comments are welcome on the game itself and
    its implementation. Also bug reports, of course. Please use this email [ref]. <br><br>

    I'd like to provide a more fun way of showing success - maybe an animated train?

<p>
    Thanks to family members for advice and support.

<p>
    I made use of many of the webs free resources to learn enough to implement this project. These include for Rust
    <a href="https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/">Rust Reference</a>, for CSS, HTML and Javascript
     <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp">W3 Schools</a> and
      <a href="https://web.learncodeonline.in/">Learn Code Online</a>. 
      Also the many sites like
     stackoverflow where solutions can be found to specific problems. <br><br>
     The source word list was produced at the <a href="http://wordlist.aspell.net/">SCOWL</a> website.
     <br><br>
     Thanks to all.
